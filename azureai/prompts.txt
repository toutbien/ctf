#prompt


#response

A specific technique for formatting instructions is to split the instructions at the beginning or end of the prompt, and have the user content contained within --- or ### blocks. These tags allow the model to more clearly differentiate between instructions and content. For example:
Translate the text into French

---
What's the weather going to be like today?
